Romanes is careful to answer this question in the negative. \"Because a lowly organized animal,\" he says, \"does not learn by its own individual experience, we may not therefore conclude that in performing its natural or ancestral adaptations to appropriate stimuli, consciousness, or the mind element, is wholly absent ; we can only say that this element, if present, reveals no evidence of the fact \" (364, p. 3).","type":"I","timestamp":"2013-10-31 14:03:06"},{"nodeID":"24591","text":"{P2 A0}   Loeb, on the other hand, writes as if absence of proof for consciousness amounted to disproof, evidently relying on the principle of parsimony, that no unnecessary assumptions should be admitted. \"Our criterion,\" he remarks, \"puts an end to the metaphysical ideas that all matter, and hence the whole animal world, possesses consciousness\" (243, p. 13).","type":"I","timestamp":"2013-10-31 14:03:06"},{"nodeID":"24592","text":"{P3 A0}   If learning by experience be really a satisfactory proof of mind, then its absence in certain animals would indeed prevent the positive assertion that all animals are conscious ; but it could not abolish the possibility that they might be.","type":"I","timestamp":"2013-10-31 14:03:06"},{"nodeID":"24593","text":"{P4 A0}    But we shall find that learning by experience, taken by itself, is too indefinite a concept to be of much service, and that when defined, it is inadequate to bear the whole weight of proving consciousness in animals.

Moreover, animals as high in the scale as dogs and cats learn to solve problems analogous to that of the combination lock so slowly that we cannot infer the presence of ideas.
