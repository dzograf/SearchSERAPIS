Various writers, giving this or that signification to the term, have maintained that man alone, of all animals, possesses reason. We have used it as synonymous with the general power of drawing inferences, a faculty which clearly depends on memory. Obviously all animals that have the power of making mental acquirements, of storing data in their memories, must possess the power of drawing inferences from them; otherwise their stores of experience would be useless, and the power of making them would not have been evolved.","type":"I","timestamp":"2013-10-31 14:12:05"},{"nodeID":"24836","text":"{P2 A0}   If a bird, for instance, attacked by a man, escaped, and subsequently fled on sight of the man without waiting to be attacked, it must draw a real inference.
