Man, pre-eminently the rational animal, is proportionately helpless at birth. His helplessness diminishes as a result of the physical and mental acquirements he makes. In this he differs from the young pigeon, which is capable of making some acquirements, but which is helpless chiefly because its instincts are deferred.","type":"I","timestamp":"2013-10-31 14:12:25"},{"nodeID":"24848","text":"{P2 A0}  \u00a0In man, therefore, the power of making acquirements has done more than supplement instinct.

The explanation is twofold. In the first place, reason confers adaptability, a faculty of enormous importance. Secondly, as a single thing it is more easy of evolution than a great number of instincts. Reason is a substitute for millions of instincts, each of which would need for its evolution and maintenance a separate process of Natural Selection.","type":"I","timestamp":"2013-10-31 14:12:26"},{"nodeID":"24850","text":"{P4 A0}   Reason for its evolution and maintenance needs only one process of Natural Selection. Natural Selection implies elimination of the unfittest. To be an effective cause of evolution it must be stringent. Many stringent processes of elimination, each the cause of a high rate of mortality, necessarily cause the extinction, not the evolution, of the species subjected to them.\u00a0","type":"I","timestamp":"2013-10-31 14:12:26"},{"nodeID":"24851","text":"{P5 A0}  There is, therefore, a natural limit to the number of instincts that may be evolved at one time in a species. 1 Nature, then, by evolving memory and its corollary reason, has discovered a way out of the difficulty ; and, by supplying that which is a substitute for an infinite number of instincts, has enabled animals to adapt themselves to the increasing complexity of their environments, and thus to achieve a higher evolution.
