The one depends on inborn mental traits, the other on acquired mental characters. INSTINCT, therefore, may be defined as that faculty which is concerned in the adaptation of means to ends by virtue of inborn inherited mental impulses and capacities for action.

He has had no previous experience of cocoons and can have no idea of the purposes they serve. But he acts as if he knew all about the uses of cocoons and the proper method of building them. Driven by his inborn impulse he sets to work at the fit time and place. Notwithstanding the total lack of all practice, his bodily parts act in exact co-ordination. Apparently his work in its beginnings is as perfect as in its endings. Unaided by memory, by learning, by practice, by acquired mental and physical traits, he rears an elaborate structure precisely suited to his needs.","type":"I","timestamp":"2013-10-31 14:08:57"},{"nodeID":"24762","text":"{P3 A0}    The man builds his house in quite a different fashion.
