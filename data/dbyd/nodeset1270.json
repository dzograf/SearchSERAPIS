In order to obtain a clear conception of the distinction between instinct and what we have termed reason, it is useful to contrast the development of an animal whose mind is almost purely instinctive with the development of one whose mind is largely rational.","type":"I","timestamp":"2013-10-31 14:11:37"},{"nodeID":"24821","text":"{P2 A0}   .... if we capture a tadpole, and, supplying it with proper food, rear it in a vessel in our own houses, it also develops into a frog perfect in body and mind. In all respects the animal is as active and his faculties are as keen as those of a frog born in the marshes.

But suppose we took a baby at birth and, were it possible, confined it in a narrow chamber so contrived that growth but not movement was permitted, ... . Suppose by some means we kept it alive, cramped and in the still darkness, for twenty or thirty years, and then opened the chamber. We should find a creature scarcely human. ... The creature would have the hair and teeth and some other structures of the adult man.

Its mind, like that of a new-born baby, would be almost a perfect blank. Light and sound and its other sensations would convey no meanings to it.

His notion of the world is only to a small extent inborn and instinctive. He inherits comparatively little of that sort from his parent, and transmits little of the kind to his child. But he is preeminently capable of learning. Though his mind is almost a blank at birth, yet every sight and sound, every sensation and experience, adds to the store of knowledge piled up in his immense memory. One frog is mentally almost similar to any other frog. Under given conditions all frogs act much alike.
