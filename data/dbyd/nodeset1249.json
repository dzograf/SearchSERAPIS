One possible mental accompaniment of this behavior is remorse; the dog is conscious that he has fallen below a moral standard, and grieved or offended his master. A second is the anticipation of punishment ; the dog has a mental representation of the consequences of his action upon former occasions, and imagining himself likely to experience them anew, is terrified at the prospect. A third possibility is that the dog's previous experience of punishment, instead of being revived in the form of definite images, makes itself effective merely in his feelings and behavior; he is uncomfortable and frightened, he knows not definitely why.","type":"I","timestamp":"2013-10-31 14:02:31"},{"nodeID":"24566","text":"{P4 A0}   It is evident that these three possibilities represent three different grades of complexity of mental process, the first being by far the highest.

We must not forget that the more complex ones remain in the field of possibility. Positive assertions have no place in comparative psychology.
